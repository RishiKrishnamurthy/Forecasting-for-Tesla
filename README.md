For this project I looked at the 2019-2023 forecast of Tesla, mainly looking at Sales. Then I move onto finding the most suitable method to forecast the Sales and Desonality through the next few years. The Tesla sales shows an upward trend between 2019 and 2022. The maximum sales was observed in 2022. The best forecast method is TAF (0.5, 0.25) because it shows the lowest mean absolute deviation from the actual sales. Over the observed 4 years, the actual Tesla sales was slightly better than the forecast. 
Looking into the future, the seasonally adjusted TAF forecast for 2023 shows a total sales of $106 Billion. Over 2023, the forecast shows a downward trend in the sales over the first two quarters of the year followed by a sharp upward trend over the next two quarters. The quarterly forecasts for 2023 are $23.3 Billion in Q1, $22.7 Billion in Q2, $27.5 Billion in Q3, and $32.6 Billion in Q4.
